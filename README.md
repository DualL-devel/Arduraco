# ArduRaCo
A control system for model railways using Arduinos.

One arduino will be connected to a roco booster for modell railways and will control the trains through it.

We are right at the beginning of development, but if you want to, please feel free to follow and help us by searching for issues...

In future this system should be able to show you where the trains are on their track by using a GUI and much more...
